# Description: You are tasked with creating a Rectangle class with the following requirements:

# An instance of the Rectangle class requires length:int and width:int to be initialized.
# We can iterate over an instance of the Rectangle class 
# When an instance of the Rectangle class is iterated over, we first get its length in the format: {'length': <VALUE_OF_LENGTH>} followed by the width {width: <VALUE_OF_WIDTH>}

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, l, w):
        self.length = l
        self.width = w
        self.dimensions = [{'length': self.length}, {'width': self.width}]

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.dimensions)
      
a = int(input("Enter the length:"))
b = int(input("Enter the width:"))

obj_rect = Rectangle(a, b)

for dimension in obj_rect:
    print(dimension)
